Requirements
\begin{enumerate}
\item We will be generating a data generator that will take a list of numbers as input and the output take a list of numbers as input and produce a list the generating by swapping 2 members of the input list as output. However, the customer has requested that he would like a List L = \{1,2,3,4\}\ to output L = \{$L_1$, ... , $L_6$\}\ as
\item $L_1$ = \{$2$,$1$,$3$,$4$\}\
\item $L_2$ = \{$3$,$2$,$1$,$4$\}\
\item $L_3$ = \{$4$,$2$,$3$,$1$\}\
\item $L_3$ = \{$1$,$3$,$2$,$4$\}\
\item $L_4$ = \{$1$,$4$,$3$,$2$\}\
\item $L_6$ = \{$1$,$2$,$4$,$3$\}\

We would suggest would rather want to have the following

\item We will be generating a data generator that will take a list of numbers as input and the output will produce a list that is generating by swapping 2 members of the input list. The data generator will go as follows:
For List L = \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}\ the customer wants the data generator to output L = \{$L_1$, ... ,$L_6$\}\ with
\begin{enumerate}
\item $L_1$ = \{$2$,$1$,$3$,$4$\}\
\item $L_2$ = \{$3$,$2$,$1$,$4$\}\
