We and every one of the group members performed an important task to overcome this difficult laboratory assignment. Each group member performed a separate task to be able to complete this laboratory assignment to complete this assignment.

Andreas acted as a programming clerk. He took care of the design documentation by writing in  latex and working with graphviz to represent a correct diagram of how the classes interact with each other.
\\
Brian acted as a tester or a test suite developer in this laboratory assignment. He had performed by writing test cases and performing junit testing to ensure that the code that is written is performing the perfect way.
\\
Matt acted as the Co-pilot by helping Anton with the input and output of all the code that was being written and acted effectively to ensure that everybody in the group was on the right track.
\\
Anton acted as the Surgeon to ensure that everybody was able to finish their task at the proper time and to ensure that test suite was being performed correctly, that the latex documentation was written, and to make sure the xml code acted in the correct way.

This lab took a hard work effort from every group member and we believe that we were able to finish this lab effectively.
